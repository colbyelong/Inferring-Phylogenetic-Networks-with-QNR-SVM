1. QNRSVMwithBootstrap.R

Main program.  Contains info for converting sequence data.  Runs Bootstrap. 

2:  SVMModel_1e+06_1200_0.25_0.75_0.05_0.4_Sept1
R file containing the SVM model used to estimate networks in all of the Primate Analysis.
Most can use as is.  Could be replaced if the user prefers to use a self-trained model.

3:  FunctionsParallelBio.R
This is contains all of the functions required for bootstrapping and running the model.
User should not need to modify.


4 Primate Run Summay

raw data corresponding to QNR-SVM runs for data sets 2,3.  Individual tabs for each
set.  QNR-SVM returns data based on the sequence indices in R.   Each tab has a dictionary
for converting between the codes, and the species names.
