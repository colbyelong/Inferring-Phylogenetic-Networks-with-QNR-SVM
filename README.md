# Inferring-Phylogenetic-Networks-with-QNR-SVM

This repository has the supplementary files for "Statistical Learning with Phylogenetic Network Invariants" by Travis Barton, Elizabeth Gross, Colby Long, and Joseph Rusinko.

The R file with the trained support vector machine exceeds GitHub's file size limit (the file is 965 MB). Thus, the file, along with the training data and the test data are available on Google Drive here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U30saBqS4F2GVS64W_PTWmYcilYQWsqt?usp=sharing

The files can also be obtained by emailing the authors.
